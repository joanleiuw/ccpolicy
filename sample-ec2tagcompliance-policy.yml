      Any instances which have previously been marked as
      non compliant with tag policies, that are now compliant
      should be unmarked as non-compliant.

      Stop all non autoscaling group instances previously marked
      for stoppage by today's date, and schedule termination in
      2 days. Also verify that they continue to not meet tagging
      policies.
